        <h3>Jared Llorens Named Interim Dean of the E. J. Ourso College of Business</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="https://files.constantcontact.com/7cb7cebd101/2f8dace6-b2fd-4f7b-8250-4e5e3b40a546.jpg">
        <p>BATON ROUGE – Professor Jared Llorens has been named interim dean of the E. J. Ourso College of Business, effective July 1, 2020. This announcement comes after the initial search for a permanent dean was paused due to the Novel Coronavirus pandemic. Llorens is currently a professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration and holds the John W. Dupuy Endowed Professorship.</p>
        <p>“While we are disappointed that the current crisis paused our national search for the dean of the College of Business, I am thrilled that Professor Llorens has agreed to step into this critical leadership position,” said Executive Vice President & Provost Stacia Haynie. “I am confident that his passion for the faculty, staff and students of the college will serve us well.” </p>
        <p>Llorens’ research focuses primarily on human resource management, with particular interests in pay comparability, civil service reform and HRM information systems. He is the former editor-in-chief of Public Personnel Management and currently serves as an associate editor of Public Administration Review. </p>
        <p>“I am truly honored by the opportunity to serve the university as interim dean of the E. J. Ourso College of Business,” said Llorens. “I look forward to working with the provost and leadership team as the university navigates the state and nation’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.” </p>
        <p>A native of Baton Rouge, he received his Ph.D. in public administration from the University of Georgia in 2007, his M.P.A. from the University of Texas at Austin’s LBJ School of Public Affairs in 1999 and his B.A. in English literature from Loyola University, New Orleans in 1996. He is a former presidential management intern (1999) and served as a human resources specialist with the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Office of Personnel Management from 1999 to 2003. Prior to his tenure at LSU, he was a faculty member in the Department of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.</p>
        <p> Llorens’ predecessor and current dean of the college, Richard White, announced his retirement in September 2019 which will be effective on June 30, 2020, after serving eight years as dean and 22 years at LSU.</p>
